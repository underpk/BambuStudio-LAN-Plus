STEP 1: INSTALL PREREQUISITES
================================================================================

You need to install these programs (in order):

1. Visual Studio 2022 Community (FREE)
   Download: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/

   IMPORTANT during installation:
   - Select "Desktop development with C++" workload
   - In Individual Components, ensure "MSVC v143" is checked
   - DO NOT use v144 or higher (breaks Boost compilation)

2. CMake
   Download: https://cmake.org/download/
   Get: "Windows x64 Installer"

   IMPORTANT during installation:
   - Check "Add CMake to the system PATH for all users"

3. Strawberry Perl
   Download: https://strawberryperl.com/
   Just install with defaults.

4. pkg-config (via Chocolatey)
   First install Chocolatey (if you don't have it):
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator
   - Run: Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

   Then install pkg-config:
   - Run: choco install pkgconfiglite

5. RESTART YOUR COMPUTER after installing everything!

================================================================================
STEP 2: BUILD
================================================================================

After installing prerequisites and restarting:

1. Open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022"
   (Search for it in Start Menu)

2. Run the build script:
   cd E:\Desktop\BambuStudio-master
   build.bat

The build takes 30-60 minutes. When complete, the application will be in:
   E:\Desktop\BambuStudio-master\install_dir\bin\bambu-studio.exe

================================================================================
WHAT THE FEATURE DOES
================================================================================

After building, in BambuStudio:
1. Go to Device tab > My Device
2. LAN devices that you have access to (unlocked) will now show an edit icon
3. Click the edit icon to rename the device
4. The name is saved locally and persists across restarts

================================================================================
UPDATING IN THE FUTURE
================================================================================

Your changes are saved in git. To see what was changed:
   cd E:\Desktop\BambuStudio-master
   git log
   git show

If you download a new version of BambuStudio:
1. Extract the new version to a new folder
2. Copy the .git folder from this directory to the new one
3. Run: git diff
4. Manually reapply changes or ask Claude to help merge
